hdkeys - Mnemonic seeds and Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) addresses.

SYNOPSIS
	hdkeys [OPTIONS]
	hdkeys [OPTIONS] [COMMAND] [COMMAND OPTIONS]

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE OPTIONS
	HDKEYS_PASSWORD
	HDKEYS_MNEMONIC
	HDKEYS_WIF

DESCRIPTION
hdkeys allows for the creation of mnemonic seeds, and Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) addresses.

- hdkeys supports BIP39 passphrase protection.
- hdkeys creates Bitcoin and Nostr accounts from the same mnemonic seeds
- hdkeys can create WIF (Wallet Import Format), and decode private keys from WIF

    BIP32 - Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets
    BIP39 - Mnemonic code for generating deterministic keys
    BIP43 - Purpose Field for Deterministic Wallets
    BIP44 - Multi-Account Hierarchy for Deterministic Wallets
    BIP49 - Derivation scheme for P2WPKH-nested-in-P2SH based accounts
    BIP84 - Derivation scheme for P2WPKH based accounts
    BIP86 - Derivation scheme for Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR) based accounts
    BIP173 - Base32 address format for native v0-16 witness outputs
    SLIP44 - Registered coin types for BIP-0044
    NIP06 - Basic key derivation from mnemonic seed phrase
    NIP05 - Mapping Nostr keys to DNS-based internet identifiers, HEX key output
