A very simple and easy to use bitcoin(btc) and nostr key/wallet generator.

- hdkeys allows for the creation of mnemonic seeds, and Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) addresses.
- hdkeys supports BIP39 passphrase protection.
- creates Bitcoin and Nostr accounts from the same mnemonic seeds
- hdkeys can create WIF (Wallet Import Format), and decode private keys from WIF
